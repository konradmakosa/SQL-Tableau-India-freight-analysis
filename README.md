During my Data Science bootcamp, one of my initial projects involved developing a detailed analysis of Indian airline connections using SQL. This project entailed the meticulous organization and examination of extensive datasets to extract meaningful insights about the aviation sector in India. I further enhanced the impact of my findings by presenting the data analysis through a series of compelling visualizations created in Tableau. <br>
These visualizations not only highlighted key patterns and trends within the data but also showcased my ability to communicate complex information effectively and engagingly. This project was a valuable exercise in data manipulation, analysis, and visual storytelling, reflecting my growing expertise in the field of Data Science.
